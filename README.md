On this website, customers are able to sell products and make money by it. On the last round, they can win the jackpot.

There are 10 rounds and 1 super round on the website. On each round customers are given random products and a deadline to sell them. On every sold product, they earn coins that can be withdrawn and customer will be moved to the next round.
Every next round is harder than previous because of products price increment, but also customers have more time to sell products.

### Playground

You can play on site by this urls:
- http://test.si.ge
- http://admin.test.si.ge
- http://partner.test.si.ge


### Web projects and environments

There are two environments:  one for staging - [test.si.ge](http://test.si.ge) and second for production - [si.ge](http://si.ge).

The solution contains three web projects:

1. - the main website where customers can register and participate. http://test.si.ge
> - api: https://github.com/gmaza/Sales-Imitation/tree/master/SalesImitation/src/presenter/SI.web
> - clientApp: https://github.com/gmaza/Sales-Imitation/tree/master/SalesImitation/src/presenter/SI.web/ClientApp


2. - an admin panel where an administrator can administrate the main website and get reports. http://admin.test.si.ge
> - api: https://github.com/gmaza/Sales-Imitation/tree/master/SalesImitation/src/presenter/SI.administration.web
> - clientApp: https://github.com/gmaza/Sales-Imitation/tree/master/SalesImitation/src/presenter/SI.administration.web/clientApp


3. - the website for partners, where they can confirm product sales. http://partner.test.si.ge
> - api: https://github.com/gmaza/Sales-Imitation/tree/master/SalesImitation/src/presenter/SI.partner.web
> - clientApp: https://github.com/gmaza/Sales-Imitation/tree/master/SalesImitation/src/presenter/SI.partner.web/clientApp
